# Software Analysis and Transformation

## Instructor

[Raffi Khatchadourian](http://www.cs.hunter.cuny.edu/~Raffi.Khatchadourian99)

## Rationale

With the rise of mobile computing, cybersecurity, and big data, the need for software engineering tools to assist developers in cultivating and managing the complexity of large software systems has never been more evident, giving way to such tools as GitHub (http://github.com), Pivotal (http://pivotal.io), and SonarQube (http://www.sonarqube.org). Software analysis and transformation has a variety of uses, including performance optimization (in compilers), decompiling, obfuscating, verifying program correctness, domain-specific programming languages, and software understanding, evolution, debugging, and testing in software engineering tools.  The material will be useful for students working in compilers, developer tools, systems, software engineering, and programming languages.

## Course description

This course introduces the foundations of algorithms that analyze and manipulate software. Refactoring, the process of reorganizing software for an improved design while preserving its original functionality, concepts and techniques will also be introduced, along with several type inferencing techniques. The course will involve hands-on experience in creating algorithms and tools. 

## List of topics

The topics may include but are not limited to:

- intermediate program representations, including Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs)
- tree traversal algorithms
- control- and data-flow analyses
- type inference
- object-orientation
- pointer/alias analysis
- side-effect analysis
- refactoring
- object-oriented software patterns

## Prerequisites

- good programming skills in an object-oriented programming language such as C++ or Java.
- CSc 71010 (Programming Languages) or equivalent or an introductory course on compilers would be useful. Otherwise, students may review the first two chapters of Compilers: Principles, Techniques and Tools by Aho, Sethi and Ullman.
