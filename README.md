# Software Analysis and Transformation

## Instructor

[Raffi Khatchadourian](http://www.cs.hunter.cuny.edu/~Raffi.Khatchadourian99)

## Rationale

With the rise of mobile computing, cybersecurity, and big data, the need for software engineering tools to assist developers in cultivating and managing the complexity of large software systems has never been more evident, giving way to such tools as [GitHub](http://github.com), [Pivotal](http://pivotal.io), and [SonarQube](http://www.sonarqube.org). Software analysis and transformation has a variety of uses, including performance optimization (in compilers), decompiling, obfuscating, verifying program correctness, domain-specific programming languages, and software understanding, evolution, debugging, and testing in software engineering tools.  The material will be useful for students working in compilers, developer tools, systems, software engineering, and programming languages.

## Course description

This course introduces the foundations of algorithms that analyze and manipulate software. Refactoring, the process of reorganizing software for an improved design while preserving its original functionality, concepts and techniques will also be introduced, along with several type inferencing techniques. The course will involve hands-on experience in creating algorithms and tools. 

## List of topics

The topics may include but are not limited to:

- intermediate program representations, including Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs)
- tree traversal and manipulation algorithms
- control- and data-flow analyses
- type inference
- object-orientation
- pointer/alias analysis
- side-effect analysis
- refactoring
- object-oriented software design patterns

## Suggested Prerequisites

- excellent programming skills in an object-oriented programming language such as C++ or Java.
- CSc 71010 (Programming Languages) or equivalent or an introductory course on compilers would be useful. Otherwise, students may review the first two chapters of *Compilers: Principles, Techniques and Tools* by Aho, Sethi and Ullman. However, previous experience in software analysis will not be assumed.

## Learning objectives

The learning goals include:

- understand abstract software representations on a meta-level
- comprehend and develop various algorithms for traversing and manipulating abstract software representations.
- relate software analysis and transformation algorithms to their application in real-world problems.
- good working knowledge of object-oriented type systems and inference.
- understand the challenges and solutions associated with analysis of software written in programming languages that allow aliasing and side-effects.
- knowledge of various software refactorings, how to formulate refactoring preconditions, and issued related to programs semantics-preservation in an object-oriented setting.
- good working knowledge of various enterprise-level software design patterns and their relationship to refactorings.

## Assessment
Several homework assignments involving technical problems related to the class lectures and reading material.Completion of the homework will benefit the students, particularly in their technical skills and problem solving. These will account for 25% of the overall grade.

In additional to homework, a sequence of projects will also be assigned. Student project topics may be selected depending on the student's research interests and goals. These will account for 55% of the overall grade.

A special topics lecture that discusses current research in the area will also be assigned, accounting for 10% of the grade, while class participating will account for the remaining 10%.
